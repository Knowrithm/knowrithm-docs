## Start conversations

### Create a conversation - `POST /api/v1/conversation`

- **Purpose**: Bootstraps a conversation for a user, lead, or admin operator.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `agent_id` | UUID | Yes | Agent that will own the conversation. |

| `metadata` | Object | No | Custom context (CRM IDs, campaign info, etc.). |
| `max_context_length` | Integer | No | Defaults to `4000`; trims history beyond this length. |

### Register a lead & conversation - `POST /api/v1/lead/register`

- **Auth**: Public  
- **Purpose**: Main widget entry point. Creates a lead, issues a scoped JWT, and opens the first conversation.

## Messaging workflow

### Queue a message - `POST /api/v1/conversation/{conversation_id}/chat`

- **Response**: `202 Accepted` with `task_id`, `conversation_id`, `message_id`, and `poll_url`.  
- **Body**: `message` (required string), optional `attachments` array.

### Stream responses - `GET /api/v1/conversation/{conversation_id}/messages/stream`

- **Protocol**: Server-Sent Events.  
- **Events**:
  - `chat_status` - lifecycle updates (`queued`, `in_progress`, `completed`, `failed`).  
  - `chat_response` - final assistant reply, citations, metrics.  
  - `heartbeat` - keep-alive ping (~15s).

### Retrieve history - `GET /api/v1/conversation/{conversation_id}/messages`
