## Base URL

```text
https://app.knowrithm.org/api/v1
```

All paths in this documentation assume the `/api/v1` prefix.

## Authentication at a glance

<Columns cols={3}>
  <Card title="Bearer tokens" icon="credit-card">
    Interactive dashboards and delegated access. Send <code>Authorization: Bearer {"<token>"}</code> on every request. Roles (`user`, `admin`, `super_admin`, `lead`) still enforce fine-grained permissions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="API keys" icon="key">
    Server-to-server workloads. Supply both <code>X-API-Key</code> and <code>X-API-Secret</code>. Keys can be scoped (`read`, `write`, `admin`) and are rate limited per tenant.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Public endpoints" icon="shield-check">
    A small set of routes (for example `GET /api/v1/agent/{agent_id}` and `POST /api/v1/website/handshake`) are explicitly marked **Public**. Everything else requires one of the headers above.
  </Card>
</Columns>

<Callout icon="exclamation-triangle">
  Unless the reference labels an endpoint as <strong>Public</strong>, be ready to authenticate with either a bearer token or paired API key headers. Administrative routes may still enforce super-admin roles even with valid credentials.
</Callout>

### Security schemes

| Scheme | Header | Typical use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bearerAuth` | `Authorization: Bearer <token>` | Dashboard users, delegated access, and interactive flows. |
| `ApiKeyAuth` | `X-API-Key: <key>` | Programmatic integrations in tandem with `X-API-Secret`. |
| `ApiSecretAuth` | `X-API-Secret: <secret>` | Second header required when authenticating via API keys. |

See the dedicated [`Authentication & API keys`](authentication) guide for end-to-end flows.

## Asynchronous workflows

Many write-heavy endpoints enqueue background jobs and immediately return:

```json
{
  "status": "accepted",
  "task_id": "7d6f1c20-9c32-4f6b-b967-f0b7b0ff5b8d",
  "status_url": "/v1/tasks/7d6f1c20-9c32-4f6b-b967-f0b7b0ff5b8d/status"
}
```

- Poll `GET {status_url}` until the task reports `state: success`.  
- Failed tasks surface `state: failure` and include a descriptive `error`.  
- Document ingestion, analytics exports, website crawls, and some agent updates dispatch to the `slow` queue; scale workers to avoid backlogs.

## Streaming conversations

- POST messages with `POST /api/v1/conversation/{conversation_id}/chat`.  
- Subscribe to `GET /api/v1/conversation/{conversation_id}/messages/stream` (Server-Sent Events) for live updates.  
- Widget integrations should call `POST /api/v1/website/handshake` first so the platform can validate origin and refresh page context.

## Error envelope

Knowrithm returns machine-readable errors:

```json
{
  "error": "Validation failed",
  "code": "DOC_001",
  "details": {
    "files": ["File too large"]
  }
}
```

- Always inspect the `code` field-it maps directly to server-side guardrails.  
- Many destructive routes are soft-delete first; call the matching `.../restore` endpoint if an action was accidental.  
- Validation errors echo field-level detail under `details`.

## Rate limiting

- Document uploads: up to **20 per minute**.  
- Database search: up to **30 requests per minute**.  
- Document search: up to **60 requests per minute**.  
- Widget handshakes: tuned per tenant, typically **5 per second**.

Exceeding limits yields `429 Too Many Requests`. Inspect the `Retry-After` header for cooldown hints.
