# Authentication API üîê

This guide covers all endpoints related to user authentication, user management, and API key management.

---

## üéØ Authentication Methods

The Knowrithm API supports two primary methods of authentication for different use cases.

### 1. API Key & Secret (Recommended for Service-to-Service)

This is the preferred method for programmatic access via the SDK or direct API calls from your backend.

**Headers:**
```http
X-API-Key: your-api-key
X-API-Secret: your-api-secret
```

### 2. JWT Bearer Token (For User-Context Actions)

JWTs are used for authenticating users in a web or mobile application context, typically for actions performed through a user interface like the Knowrithm dashboard.

**Header:**
```http
Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
```
