## Example Patterns

### Customer Support Assistant

```python
agent = client.agents.create_agent({
    "name": "Support Desk",
    "description": "Handles tier-one support inquiries",
    "status": "active"
})

client.documents.upload_documents(
    agent_id=agent["id"],
    urls=["https://docs.example.com/knowledge-base"]
)

conversation = client.conversations.create_conversation(agent_id=agent["id"])
reply = client.messages.send_message(
    conversation_id=conversation["id"],
    message="How do I reset my password?"
)

print(reply["history"][-1]["assistant_response"])
```

### Lead Qualification Funnel

```python
payload = {
    "agent_id": agent["id"],
    "first_name": "Alex",
    "last_name": "Rivera",
    "email": "alex@example.com",
    "consent_marketing": True
}

lead = client.leads.register_lead(payload)
print(f"Lead registered: {lead['id']}")
```

### Analytics Snapshot

```python
metrics = client.analytics.get_agent_analytics(
    agent_id=agent["id"],
    start_date="2025-09-01",
    end_date="2025-09-30"
)

print(f"Conversations: {metrics['summary']['conversation_count']}")
print(f"Average satisfaction: {metrics['quality']['avg_rating']}")
```

## Learning Path

1. **Foundations**: installation, authentication, first agent
2. **Knowledge ingestion**: document uploads, database connectors, search
3. **Experience design**: conversation flows, lead capture, widget integration
4. **Operations**: analytics dashboards, performance tuning, alerting
5. **Production**: deployments, security hardening, disaster recovery

Use the checklist inside each tutorial to track progress.
