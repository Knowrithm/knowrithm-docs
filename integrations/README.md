## Integration Patterns

### Customer Support Automation

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Customer on Website] --> B{Chat Widget};
    B --> C[Knowrithm Agent];
    C --> D{Needs Human?};
    D -- No --> B;
    D -- Yes --> E[Webhook Sent];
    E --> F[Create Ticket in Zendesk/Jira];
    F --> G[Notify Support on Slack];
```

1.  A customer interacts with the **Chat Widget** on your site.
2.  The **Knowrithm Agent** handles the conversation.
3.  If human intervention is needed, the agent triggers a **Webhook**.
4.  Your backend service receives the webhook and creates a support ticket in a system like **Zendesk** and notifies your team on **Slack**.

### Lead Generation Funnel

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Prospect on Website] --> B{Chat Widget};
    B --> C[Knowrithm Agent];
    C --> D{Qualifies Lead};
    D -- Yes --> E[Webhook: lead.created];
    E --> F[Add Lead to Salesforce/HubSpot];
    F --> G[Assign to Sales Rep];
```

1.  A prospect engages with the **Chat Widget**.
2.  The **Knowrithm Agent** asks qualifying questions.
3.  Once qualified, the agent creates a lead, triggering the `lead.created` **Webhook**.
4.  Your system captures the webhook and pushes the new lead data into your **CRM (e.g., Salesforce)**.
