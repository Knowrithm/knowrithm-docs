## Platform Overview

Knowrithm is a comprehensive enterprise platform that enables companies to create, train, and deploy intelligent chatbot agents. It combines advanced natural language processing with multi-source data integration and scalable infrastructure.

The platform is built to help organizations:

- **Deploy Specialized Agents**: Create multiple AI agents for specific roles (e.g., Sales, Support) with isolated contexts.
- **Unified Knowledge Base**: Train agents on documents (PDF, DOCX), live databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL), and web content.
- **Enterprise Security**: Manage access with multi-level authentication, JWTs, scoped API keys, and strict tenant isolation.
- **Actionable Analytics**: Track lead conversions, agent performance, and system health through real-time dashboards.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I get started with Knowrithm?" icon="rocket">
    Follow our [Quickstart guide](/quickstart) to deploy your first agent in under 10 minutes. You'll need Docker or Python 3.11+ with PostgreSQL and Redis.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What databases are supported?" icon="database">
    Knowrithm supports PostgreSQL and MySQL for live database connections. You can also ingest data from any database by uploading CSV exports or connecting via custom connectors. See our [Data Sources documentation](/platform/data-sources) for details.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I use my own LLM provider?" icon="brain">
    Yes! Knowrithm supports OpenAI, Anthropic, and any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Configure your preferred model and provider in the agent settings. You can even use different models for different agents.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Is there a free tier or pricing?" icon="dollar-sign">
    Knowrithm is open-source and self-hosted, so you only pay for your infrastructure (cloud hosting, databases) and <Tooltip tip="Large Language Model">LLM</Tooltip> API costs. There are no platform fees or usage limits.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I handle authentication and security?" icon="lock">
    Knowrithm uses <Tooltip tip="JSON Web Tokens - secure method for transmitting information between parties">JWT</Tooltip> tokens for user authentication and scoped <Tooltip tip="Application Programming Interface">API</Tooltip> keys for programmatic access. All endpoints support role-based access control and tenant isolation. See our [Authentication guide](/api-reference/authentication) for implementation details.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I customize the chat widget?" icon="palette">
    Absolutely! The chat widget is fully customizable with your brand colors, logo, and messaging. You can also modify the widget's behavior, position, and styling through configuration options.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What file formats are supported for knowledge bases?" icon="file">
    Knowrithm supports PDF, DOCX, TXT, HTML, and Markdown files. The platform automatically extracts text, handles OCR for scanned documents, and chunks content for optimal retrieval.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How does the platform handle scaling?" icon="chart-line">
    Knowrithm uses Celery for distributed task processing, Redis for caching and queuing, and PostgreSQL for data persistence. You can scale horizontally by adding more worker nodes and vertically by increasing database resources.
