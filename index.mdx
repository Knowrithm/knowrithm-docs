## Platform Overview

Knowrithm is a comprehensive enterprise platform that enables companies to create, train, and deploy intelligent chatbot agents. It combines advanced natural language processing with multi-source data integration and scalable infrastructure.

The platform is built to help organizations:

- **Deploy Specialized Agents**: Create multiple AI agents for specific roles (e.g., Sales, Support) with isolated contexts.
- **Unified Knowledge Base**: Train agents on documents (PDF, DOCX), live databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL), and web content.
- **Enterprise Security**: Manage access with multi-level authentication, JWTs, scoped API keys, and strict tenant isolation.
- **Actionable Analytics**: Track lead conversions, agent performance, and system health through real-time dashboards.
