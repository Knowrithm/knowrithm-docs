<Update label="2025-11-20" description="v1.2.0 - Multi-agent Orchestration">
  ## Multi-agent Orchestration
  
  We've released a major update to how agents coordinate. You can now define "supervisor" agents that delegate tasks to specialized sub-agents.

  ### Features
  - **Supervisor Mode**: New agent type that routes queries to other agents based on intent.
  - **Shared Memory**: Agents in the same workspace now share a short-term memory context.
  - **Debug Console**: Inspect the reasoning trace of multi-agent handoffs in real-time.

  ### Improvements
  - Reduced latency for agent-to-agent communication by 40%.
  - Added `X-Agent-Trace-Id` header to all API responses for better observability.
