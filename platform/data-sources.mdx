Knowrithm acts as a central intelligence layer by ingesting data from various sources. Once connected, this data is indexed, embedded, and made available to your AI agents for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

## Supported Sources

We support a wide range of data sources to ensure your agents have access to the most relevant information.

### Web Crawler

The web crawler allows you to index public websites. This is useful for adding documentation, blog posts, and company information to your knowledge base.

- **Single Page:** Index a specific URL.
- **Site Map:** Index an entire site using its `sitemap.xml`.
- **Crawl Depth:** Configure how deep the crawler should go (e.g., follow links up to 2 levels).

### Files

Upload documents directly to the platform. We support the following file formats:

- **PDF** (`.pdf`)
- **Word** (`.docx`)
- **Text** (`.txt`)
- **Markdown** (`.md`, `.mdx`)
- **CSV** (`.csv`) - *Best for structured data*

### Integrations

Connect directly to your existing tools. (Coming soon)

- **Notion:** Sync pages and databases.
- **Google Drive:** Index Docs, Sheets, and Slides.
- **Slack:** Ingest public channels for internal knowledge.

## Managing Sources

You can manage your data sources from the **Knowledge Base** section of the dashboard.

1. **Add Source:** Click "New Data Source" and select the type (Web, File, etc.).
2. **Configure:** Enter the necessary details (URL, upload file, or authenticate integration).
3. **Index:** The system will automatically start processing the data.

### Status

Each source has a status indicator:

- **Indexing:** The system is currently processing the data.
- **Ready:** The data is indexed and ready for use.
- **Error:** There was a problem processing the source. Check the logs for details.

## Syncing

Data sources can be configured to sync automatically.

- **Web Sources:** Can be scheduled to re-crawl daily or weekly.
- **Integrations:** typically use webhooks to sync changes in real-time or near real-time.
- **Files:** Must be manually updated by uploading a new version.
