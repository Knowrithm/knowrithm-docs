# Agent Test Command

The `knowrithm agent test` command provides a beautiful, user-friendly testing experience with rich formatting and interactive chat capabilities.

## New Features

### 1. Beautiful Output Formatting

Instead of showing raw JSON in a table, the test results are now displayed in a clean, organized format:

```
🧪 Testing agent 'Knowrithm Support'...

❓ Query:

### 2. Interactive Chat Session

New `--interactive` (or `-i`) flag allows you to start a chat session immediately after testing:

```bash
# Test and automatically start chat
knowrithm agent test --interactive

# Or with short flag
knowrithm agent test -i
```

After the test completes, you'll be prompted:
```
💬 Would you like to start an interactive chat session with this agent? (Y/n)
```

If you select "Yes", it will:
1. Create a new conversation
2. Launch the interactive chat interface
3. Allow you to continue chatting with the agent

### 3. Rich Spinner Animation

While the agent is processing, you'll see an animated spinner:
```
⠋ Agent is thinking...
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Test
```bash
# Test with default query
knowrithm agent test

# Test with custom query
knowrithm agent test --query "What are your pricing plans?"

### Interactive Mode

knowrithm agent test --interactive

# Test with custom query and start chat

```

### Different Output Formats
