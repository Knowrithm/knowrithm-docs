# Geographic Data Interactive Menu

The CLI supports interactive menu selections for geographic data operations (countries, states, and cities), making it significantly more user-friendly than manually looking up IDs.

## Interactive Commands

You can run the following commands without arguments to trigger the interactive selection mode:

```bash
# Shows country selection menu
knowrithm system country

# Shows country selection menu, then lists states
knowrithm system states

# Shows state selection menu (via country → state)
knowrithm system state

# Shows state selection menu (via country → state), then lists cities
knowrithm system cities

# Shows city selection menu (via country → state → city)
knowrithm system city
```

## User Experience Flow

### Example: Viewing a City

**Command:**
```bash
knowrithm system city
```

**Flow:**
1. Shows "🗺️ First, select a state:"
2. Shows "🌍 First, select a country:"
3. Displays interactive menu of countries (e.g., "United States (US)")
4. After country selection, displays menu of states (e.g., "California (CA)")
5. After state selection, displays menu of cities (e.g., "San Francisco")
6. Displays the selected city's details

### Example: Listing States

**Command:**

```

**Flow:**

## Benefits

- **No ID Memorization**: You don't need to know or look up IDs.
- **Guided Navigation**: Natural hierarchical flow (country → state → city).
- **Visual Feedback**: Emoji indicators and clear prompts guide you.
- **Backward Compatible**: Still accepts IDs directly for scripting/automation.
